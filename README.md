# Arabic Keyboard Image Processing 

In this Project, I have applied the principles of image processing to develop a keyboard input. 
Which take the input from the user throughout camera and hands movement to output an Arabic letter selected by the user

## Main tools 
I have used OpenCV with mediapip library to detect the hands and fingers position 

## Files

### main
this file contain the main script for the code

### arial
This file is arial font because opencv does not support arabic directly

#### other files are related to pycharm project layout.
